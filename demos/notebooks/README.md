To run some of the scripts or notebooks, you need to install the bids examples repository
in this directory

```

# Running the notebooks with Octave

1.  Make sure that you have Octave installed.

1.  If you have Conda/Jupyter/pip installed, go to step 4. Check if Conda is
    installed properly by typing `conda list` into your terminal

1.  Download the
    [Anaconda Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and
    install it. If using miniconda, run `conda install jupyter` to download and
    install the Jupyter Notebook package.

1.  Install [Octave kernel](https://pypi.org/project/octave-kernel/):
    `pip install octave_kernel`

1.  Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. `Octave` should appear on the list
    for creating a new notebook.

    1. Make sure you have bids-matlab in the path and JSONio.

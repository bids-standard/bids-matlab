# BIDS for MATLAB / Octave

This repository aims at centralising MATLAB/Octave tools to interact with datasets conforming to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format.

For more information about BIDS, visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io/.

See also [PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) for Python and the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

## Installation

Download this repository and add it to your MATLAB/Octave path.

```Matlab
unzip('https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/archive/master.zip');
addpath('bids-matlab-master');
```
If your version of MATLAB/Octave does not support JSON natively, please also install [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) or [JSONio](https://github.com/gllmflndn/JSONio).

## Usage

```Matlab
BIDS = bids.layout('/home/data/ds000117');
bids.query(BIDS, 'subjects')
```

A [tutorial](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb) is available as a Jupyter Notebook and can be run interactively via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bids-standard/bids-matlab/master?filepath=examples/tutorial.ipynb).

## Requirements

BIDS-MATLAB works with MATLAB R2014a or newer, or Octave 4.2.2 or newer. (It may also work with older versions, but those are not actively supported.)

If you are using MATLAB R2016b or newer, nothing else needs to be installed.

If you are using MATLAB R2016a or older, or using Octave, you need to install a supported JSON library for your MATLAB or Octave. This can be any of:

  * [JSONio](https://github.com/gllmflndn/JSONio) for MATLAB or Octave
  * [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)

## Implementation

Starting point was `spm_BIDS.m` from [SPM12](https://github.com/spm/spm12) ([documentation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/BIDS#BIDS_parser_and_queries)) reformatted in a `+bids` package with dependencies to other SPM functions removed.

## Other tools (MATLAB only)
- [dicm2nii](https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii): A DICOM to BIDS converter
- [imtool3D_BIDS](https://github.com/tanguyduval/imtool3D_td): A 3D viewer for BIDS directory

# BIDS for MATLAB / Octave

This repository aims at centralising MATLAB/Octave tools to interact with
datasets conforming to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format.

For more information about BIDS, visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io/.

Join our chat on the
[BIDS-MATLAB channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bids-matlab)
on the brainhack mattermost and our [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/bids-matlab).

See also [PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) for Python and the
[BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

## Installation

Download, unzip this repository and add its content to the MATLAB/Octave path.

```Matlab
unzip('https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/archive/main.zip');
addpath('bids-matlab-main');
```

Or clone it with git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab.git
```

and then add it to your MATLAB/Octave path.

```Matlab
addpath('bids-matlab');
```

### Get the latest features

Stable versions should be fetched from a specific version tag.

The latest features of bids-matlab that are in development are in our `main`
"branch".

To access them you can either download the `main` branch from there:
https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/tree/main

Or you can check it out the `main` branch after the adding this official
bids-matlab repository as a remote.

```
git add remote upstream https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab.git
git checkout upstream/main
```

## Features

### What this toolbox can do

- read the layout of a BIDS dataset (see `bids.layout`),
- perform queries on that layout to get information about the subjects,
  sessions, runs, modalities, metadata... contained within that dataset (see
  `bids.query`),
- parse the layout of "BIDS-derivative compatible" datasets (like those
  generated by fMRIprep),

- create BIDS compatible filenames or folder structures for raw or derivatives
  datasets (`bids.File`, `bids.util.mkdir`,
  `bids.dataset_description`),
- do basic copying of files to help initialize a derivative dataset
  to start a new analysis (`bids.copy_to_derivative`),

- generate a human readable report of the content of BIDS data set containing
  anatomical MRI, functional MRI, diffusion weighted imaging, field map data
  (see `bids.report`)
- read and write JSON files (see `bids.util.jsondecode` and
  `bids.util.jsonwrite`) provided that the right
  [dependencies](#reading-and-writing-json-files) are installed,
- read and write TSV files (see `bids.util.tsvread` and `bids.util.tsvwrite`)

- access and query the BIDS schema (bids.schema)

The behavior of this toolbox assumes that it is interacting with a valid BIDS
dataset that should have been validated using
[BIDS-validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/). If the
Node.js version of the validator is
[installed on your computer](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#quickstart),
you can call it from the matlab prompt using `bids.validate`. Just be aware that
any unvalidated components may produce undefined behavior. Although, if you're
BIDS-y enough, the behavior may be predictable.

### What this toolbox cannot do... yet

- generate human readable reports of the content of BIDS data with EEG, MEG,
  iEEG, physio and events data,
- deal with some of the incoming BIDS extensions (BIDS model...)

### What will this toolbox most likely never do

- act as a Matlab / Octave based BIDS-validator
- act as a BIDS converter
- implement reading / writing capabilities for the different modality-specific
  data format that exist in BIDS (`.nii`, `.eeg`, `.ds`, `.fif`...)

## Usage

BIDS matlab is structured as package, so you can easily access functions in subfolders
that start with `+`.

To use the `+bids/layout.m` function:

```Matlab
BIDS = bids.layout('/home/data/ds000117');
bids.query(BIDS, 'subjects')
```

To use the `+bids/+util/jsondecode.m` function:

```Matlab
content = bids.util.jsondecode('/home/data/some_json_file.json');
```

A
[tutorials](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/blob/main/lib/bids-matlab/demos/notebooks)
are available as a Jupyter Notebooks and scripts and can be run interactively via
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bids-standard/bids-matlab/main?urlpath=demos).

## Requirements

BIDS-MATLAB works with:

- Octave 5.2.0 or newer
- MATLAB R2014a or newer

We aim for compatibility with the latest stable release of Octave at any time.
Compatibility can sometimes also be achieved with older versions of Octave but
this is not guaranteed.

### Reading and writing JSON files

If you are using MATLAB R2016b or newer, nothing else needs to be installed.

If you are using MATLAB R2016a or older, or using Octave, you need to install a
supported JSON library for your MATLAB or Octave. This can be any of:

- [JSONio](https://github.com/gllmflndn/JSONio) for MATLAB or Octave
- [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)

## Implementation

Starting point was `spm_BIDS.m` from [SPM12](https://github.com/spm/spm12)
([documentation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/BIDS#BIDS_parser_and_queries))
reformatted in a `+bids` package with dependencies to other SPM functions
removed.

For the {{TaskName}} task, {{nb_runs}} run(s) of {{suffix}} {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}} fMRI data were collected.

The acquisition parameters were: {{nb_slices}} slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; repetition time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}} s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel size= {{vox_size}} mm; multiband factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor= {pr_str}}.

Each run was {{length}} minutes in length, during which {{nb_vols}} functional volumes were acquired.

**Welcome to the BIDS Specification repository!**

_We're so excited you're here and want to contribute._

We hope that these guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know
by [opening an issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/issues/new).

If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub,
check our [generic contributing guidelines](https://bids-website.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collaboration/bids_github/CONTRIBUTING.html).

If you want to contribute to the BIDS matlab codebase,
make sure you also read the instructions below.

## Style guide

### Writing in markdown

For anything that is in markdown we have a soft rule that aims to enforce
"hardline wrapping" to make sure that lines wrap around at a certain line
length. The main reason is that it makes it easier for reviewers to detect the
changes so in a whole paragraph.

Some editors can automatically enforce hard-line wrapping with some linter like
`Prettier` so that you are always only a shortcut away from a tidy document. See
an example with visual-studio code
[here](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/configure-prettier-in-vscode/#saving-without-formatting).

### Matlab code style guide and quality

We use the [MISS_HIT linter](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/) to
automatically enforce / fix some code style issues and check for
[code quality](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/code-quality.html).

The linter is a Python package that can be installed with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<details><summary> <b>ðŸ’» Installing Python</b> </font> </summary><br>

If you do not have Python on your computer, we warmly recommend the install
instruction from the
[datalad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html).

</details>

The rules followed by MISS_HIT are in the
[MISS_HIT configuration file](./miss_hit.cfg).

To check the code style of the whole repository, you can can simply type:

```bash
mh_style .
```

Some styling issues can be automatically fixed by using the `--fix` flag. You
might need to rerun this command several times if there are a lot of issues.

```bash
mh_style . --fix
```

Code quality can be checked with:

```bash
mh_metric .
```

To see only the issues that "break" the code quality rules set in the
configuration file, type:

```bash
mh_metric . --ci
```

The code style and quality is also checked during the continuous integration.

For more information about MISS_HIT see its
[documentation](https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/).

## Running tests on the code

We use a series of unit and integration tests to make sure the code behaves as
expected and to also help in development.
The unit and integration tests we have are in the [`tests` folder]'(./tests/)
and should be run with [MoxUnit](https://moxunit.github.io/MOxUnit/).

If you are not sure what unit and integration tests are, check the chapter about
that in the
[Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/testing.html).

### Install MoxUnit

You need to install
[MOxUnit for matlab and octave](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit) to run the
tests.

Note the install procedure will require you to have
[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
If you don't,
you can always download the MoxUnit code with this
[link](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit/archive/master.zip).

Run the following from a terminal in the folder where you want to install MOxUnit.
The `make install` command will find Matlab / Octave on your system and
make sure it plays nice with MoxUnit.

NOTE: only type in the terminal what is after the `$` sign:

```bash
# get the code for MOxUnit with git
git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git
# enter the newly created folder and set up MoxUnit
cd MOxUnit
make install
```

If you want to check the code coverage on your computer, you can also install
[MOcov for matlab and octave](https://github.com/MOcov/MOcov).
Note that this is
also part of the continuous integration of the bids-matlab, so you don't need to
do this.

### Install the test data

To run the tests we used the examples data sets from the
[bids-examples repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples)
and also create some dummy datasets.

This requires python to be installed as a python script is used
to generate the dummy datasets.

```bash
cd tests
make data
```

or

```bash
cd tests
pip install pandas
python create_dummy_data_set.py
git clone https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples.git --depth 1
```

### Add helper functions to the path

There are a some help functions you need
to add to the Matlab / Octave path to run the tests:

```matlab
addpath(fullfile('tests', 'utils'))
```

### Run the tests

From the root folder of the bids-matlab folder, you can run the test with one
the following commands.

```bash
moxunit_runtests tests

# Or if you want more feedback
moxunit_runtests tests -verbose
```

### Adding more tests

You can use the following function template to write more tests.

```matlab
function test_suite = test_functionToTest()
    % This top function is necessary for mox unit to run tests.
    % DO NOT CHANGE IT except to adapt the name of the function.
    try % assignment of 'localfunctions' is necessary in Matlab >= 2016
        test_functions = localfunctions(); %#ok<*NASGU>
    catch % no problem; early Matlab versions can use initTestSuite fine
    end
    initTestSuite;
end

function test_function_to_test_basic()

    %% set up


    %% data to test against


    %% test
    % assertTrue( );
    % assertFalse( );
    % assertEqual( );

end


function test_function_to_test_other_usecase()

    %% set up


    %% data to test against


    %% test
    % assertTrue( );
    % assertFalse( );
    % assertEqual( );

end

```

### Timing

If you need to load a dummy datasets check the `layout_timing` function as it as
a list of all the bids-matlab datasets and how loing it takes (more or less) to
run layout on each.


## Building the documentation

The documentation is generated with the `Sphinx` python package
and the help section of all the functions and classes
is used to create the code documentation
thanks to the `sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain` sphinx extension.

### Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build the documentation locally

From the `docs` directory run:

```bash
make html
```

or if you do not have make:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html source build
```

This will build an html version of the doc in the `build` folder.

### reStructured text markup

reStructured text mark up primers:

-   on the [sphinx site](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)

-   more
    [python oriented](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html)

-   typical doc strings templates
    -   [google way](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html)
    -   [numpy](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html#example-numpy)

### "Templates"

If you need to create a new page in the doc to automatically
document your code, here is a 'template' to help you get started.

```rst

.. automodule:: +bids.folder_name .. <-- This is necessary for auto-documenting the rest

.. autofunction:: function to document

```

To get the filenames of all the functions in a folder to add them to a file:

``` bash
ls -l +bids/*.m | cut -c42- | rev | cut -c 3- | rev | sed s/+bids/".. autofunction::"/g
```

Increase the `42` to crop more characters at the beginning.

Change the `3` to crop more characters at the end.

  "description": "Possible values: `\"i\"`, `\"j\"`, `\"k\"`, `\"i-\"`, `\"j-\"`, `\"k-\"`.\nThe letters `i`, `j`, `k` correspond to the first, second and third axis of\nthe data in the NIFTI file.\nThe polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to\nmaximum index unless `-` sign is present\n(then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index instead of\nzero).\n`PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the direction along which phase is was\nmodulated which may result in visible distortions.\nNote that this is not the same as the DICOM term\n`InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values.\n",

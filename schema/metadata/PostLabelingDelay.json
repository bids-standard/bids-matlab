  "description": "This is the postlabeling delay (PLD) time, in seconds, after the end of the\nlabeling (for `\"CASL\"` or `\"PCASL\"`) or middle of the labeling pulse\n(for `\"PASL\"`) until the middle of the excitation pulse applied to the\nimaging slab (for 3D acquisition) or first slice (for 2D acquisition).\nCan be a number (for a single-PLD time series) or an array of numbers\n(for multi-PLD and Look-Locker).\nIn the latter case, the array of numbers contains the PLD of each volume,\nnamely each `control` and `label`, in the acquisition order.\nAny image within the time-series without a PLD, for example an `m0scan`,\nis indicated by a zero.\nBased on DICOM Tags 0018, 9079 `Inversion Times` and 0018, 0082\n`InversionTime`.\n",

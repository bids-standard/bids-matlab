               MoAEpilot example epoch (block) fMRI dataset
________________________________________________________________________

This experiment was conducted by Geraint Rees under the direction of
Karl Friston and the FIL methods group. The purpose was to explore new
equipment and techniques.  As such it has not been formally written up,
and is freely available for personal education and evaluation purposes.

These whole brain BOLD/EPI images were acquired on a modified 2T
Siemens MAGNETOM Vision system.  Each acquisition consisted of 64
contiguous slices (64x64x64 3mm x 3mm x 3mm voxels).  Acquisition took
6.05s, with the scan to scan repeat time (RT) set arbitrarily to 7s.

96 acquisitions were made (RT=7s), in blocks of 6, giving 16 42s
blocks. The condition for successive blocks alternated between rest and
auditory stimulation, starting with rest. Auditory stimulation was
bi-syllabic words presented binaurally at a rate of 60 per minute. Due
to T1 effects it is advisable to discard the first few scans (there were
no "dummy" lead-in scans).

A structural image was also acquired.

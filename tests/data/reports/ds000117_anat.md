### Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### Fast-Low-Angle-Shot image

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}}
system from {{Manufacturer}}, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}.
The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

{{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}} FLASH structural
MRI data were collected ({{nb_slices}} slices; repetition time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}}
s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field
of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel size= {{vox_size}}
mm).

#### T1-weighted image

The data acquisition was performed in the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
{{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 15 Chaucer Road, Cambridge CB2 7EF, UK.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a TrioTim system from Siemens, with serial
number 35119. The software version was syngo_MR_B15.

MPRAGE GR_IR SP_MP_OSP T1w structural MRI data were collected ({{nb_slices}} slices;

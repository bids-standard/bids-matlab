MEG REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
15 Chaucer Road, Cambridge, UK.

Recordings were acquired using a ElektaVectorview system from ElektaNeuromag, with
serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

For the facerecognition task, 6 run(s) of meg data were collected. Power line and
sampling frequencies were 50 Hz and 1100 Hz, respectively. Data was collected
with 306 MEG channels, {{ECOGChannelCount}} iEEG surface channels, {{SEEGChannelCount}}
iEEG depth channels, 70 EEG channels, 2 EOG channels, 1 ECG channels and
0 EMG channels recorded simultaneously.

Subjects viewed stimuli on a screen during six, 7.5 minute runs. The stimuli were
photographs of either a face or a scrambled face, and appeared for a random duration
between 800 and 1,000 ms. Subjects were instructed to fixate centrally throughout
the experiment. To ensure attention to each stimulus, participants were
asked to press one of two keys with either their left or right index finger (assignment
counter-balanced across participants). Their key-press was based on how
symmetric they regarded each image: pressing one or the other key depending whether
they thought the image was 'more' or 'less symmetric' than average. See publication
for more detailed information. Participants were specifically instructed
to: {{Instructions}}

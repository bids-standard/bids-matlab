### Diffusion-Weighted Imaging data

#### Diffusion-weighted image

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}}
system from {{Manufacturer}}, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}.
The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

1 run of {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}} diffusion-weighted-imaging
(dwi) data were collected ({{nb_slices}} slices ; repetition
time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}} s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA=
{{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}} ; voxel
size= {{vox_size}} mm ; b-values of XXX acquired; XXX diffusion directions;
multiband factor= {{mb_str}} ).

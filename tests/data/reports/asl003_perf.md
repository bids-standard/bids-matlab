### Perfusion imaging data

#### Arterial Spin Labeling

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a TrioTim system from Siemens, with serial
number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The software version was N4_VB17A_LATEST_20090307.

3Dgrase RM SK asl perfusion MRI data were collected ({{nb_slices}} slices; repetition
time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}} ms; echo time, TE= 0.01192 s; flip angle, FA=
180 deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel size=
{{vox_size}} mm)

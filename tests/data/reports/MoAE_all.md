# Data description


### Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### T1-weighted image

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}}
system from {{Manufacturer}}, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}.
The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

{{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}} T1w structural MRI
data were collected (54 slices; repetition time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}} s; echo
time, TE= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV=
256 X 256 mm; matrix size= 256 X 256; voxel size= 1.00 X 1.00 X 3.00 mm).

### Task-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### BOLD data

##### Task auditory data

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at 2 Tesla using a MAGNETOM Vision system from Siemens,
with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

For the Auditory task, 1 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}}
{{SequenceVariant}} fMRI data were collected. The acquisition parameters were:
64 slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; repetition time, TR= 7 s; echo time,
TE= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= 192
X 192 mm; matrix size= 64 X 64; voxel size= 3.00 X 3.00 X 3.00 mm; multiband
factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor= {pr_str}}. Each run was 9.8 minutes
in length, during which 84 functional volumes were acquired.

FUNC REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at 2 Tesla using a MAGNETOM Vision system from Siemens,
with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

For the Auditory task, 1 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}}
{{SequenceVariant}} fMRI data were collected. The acquisiton parameters were:
64 slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; repetition time, TR= 7 s; echo time,
TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= 192.00
X 192.00 mm; matrix size= 64 X 64; voxel size= 3.00 X 3.00 X 3.00 mm; multiband
factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor= {pr_str}}. Each run was
9.8 minutes in length, during which 84 functional volumes were acquired.

FUNC REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at 2 Tesla using a MAGNETOM Vision system from Siemens,
with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

For the Auditory task, 1 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}}
{{SequenceVariant}} fMRI data were collected. The acquisiton parameters were:
{{nb_slices}} slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; repetition time, TR= 7 s;
echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view,
FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel size= {{vox_size}} mm; multiband
factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor= {pr_str}}. Each run was
{{length}} minutes in length, during which {{nb_vols}} functional volumes were
acquired.

The condition for successive blocks alternated between rest and auditory stimulation,
starting with rest. Auditory stimulation was with bi-syllabic words presented
binaurally at a rate of 60 per minute. Participants were specifically instructed
to: {{Instructions}}

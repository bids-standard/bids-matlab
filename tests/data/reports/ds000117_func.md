FUNC REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit,
{{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 15 Chaucer Road, Cambridge CB2 7EF, UK.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a TrioTim system from Siemens, with serial
number 35119. The software version was syngo_MR_B15.

For the facerecognition task, 9 run(s) of events EPI EP SK fMRI data were collected.
The acquisiton parameters were: {{nb_slices}} slices acquired in a {{so_str}}
fashion; repetition time, TR= 2 s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle,
FA= 78 deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel
size= {{vox_size}} mm; multiband factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration factor=
{pr_str}}. Each run was {{length}} minutes in length, during which {{nb_vols}}
functional volumes were acquired.

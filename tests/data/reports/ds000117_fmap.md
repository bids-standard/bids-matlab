### Field maps data

#### Magnitude

The data acquisition was performed in the {{InstitutionName}}, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}}
system from {{Manufacturer}}, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}.
The software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

A {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}} field map (phase
encoding: {{PhaseEncodingDirection}}; {{nb_slices}} slices; repetition time, TR=
{{RepetitionTime}} s; echo time 1 / 2, TE 1/2= {{echo_time}} s; flip angle, FA=
{{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}};
voxel size= {{vox_size}} mm) was acquired.
